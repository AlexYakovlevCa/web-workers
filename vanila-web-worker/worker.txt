1.what is the difference between self and this?
2.what is a worker?
3. what is the difference between serviceWorker and webWorker?


















































1.  The keyword self is used to refer to the current class itself 
    within the scope of that class only whereas, "this" is used to 
    refer to the member variables and function 
    for a particular instance of a class.

    Unless set elsewhere, the value of self is window because JavaScript
    lets you access any property x of window as simply x, instead of window.x.
    Therefore, self is really window.self, which is different to this.















2.  worker is a script that runs on a thread separate 
    to the browserâ€™s main thread.





















3.  ervice workers are a proxy between the browser and
    the network. By intercepting requests made by the document,
    service workers can redirect requests to a cache, enabling offline 
    access. Web workers are general-purpose scripts that enable us to offload
    processor-intensive work from the main thread.
